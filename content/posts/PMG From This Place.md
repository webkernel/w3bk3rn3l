## 1 Pat Metheny's new album is orchestrated and bold
by **Emerson Lopes*** (my translation)

<br>

<br>

Almost five decades have passed since the first album released by American guitarist **Pat Metheny**. During all these years, the musician has always sought to challenge himself musically. Solo, in duet, in trio, in quartet, with orchestra, it doesn't matter, his records have never gone unnoticed.  

Today, at the age of 66, **Metheny** returns to the scene with a record that matches his talent and history. **From This Place** features the guitarist propped up by the Hollywood Studio orchestra, conducted by **Joel McNeely** with arrangements by experienced pianists **Alan Broadbent** and **Gil Goldstein**, who already worked with Metheny in the 1990s.

It is not the first time that the guitarist has an orchestra accompanying him but this is undoubtedly his best partnership with this type of arrangement. To help him in this new endeavor he cast his usual trio formed by **Antonio Sánchez** (drums), **Linda May Han Oh** (bass) and **Gwilym Simcock** (pianist).

For the fan of the guitarist it will be impossible to hear this album and not remember the album **Secret Story** (1992) considered by many to be the most daring album of his career. The references are in almost all the songs. Right in the first theme **America Undefined**, with 13 minutes of duration, it is possible to feel the music taking shape and expanding the listener's sound horizons. The orchestra creates an atmosphere of immensity and Sánchez's drums pulsates with strength and precision.

The formula is repeated in **Wide and Far** this time with more space for the involving phrases of Metheny's guitar, and **You Are**. In **Pathmaker** McNeely's orchestra is present but with the subtlety necessary to let the quartet play its leading role. The same is true of **Sixty-Six** with music offering a roller coaster of sensations and a little nostalgia by recreating the drums of one of Metheny's most popular compositions: **Last Train Home**.

With the presence of the orchestra more introspective and delicate themes could not be missing. That's what the musician brings in **Love May Take A While**, in the touching **From This Place** with the voice of **Meshell Ndegeocello** and in **The Past in Us** with the harmonica of **Gregoire Maret** and the percussion of **Luis Conte**.

The famous synthesized guitar that marked Metheny's career appears in **Same River** with the characteristic sound of Pat Metheny Group. Finally **Everything Explained** which could not have a more perfect name to synthesize the sound of the album. The pulsating theme features Metheny taking the lead in her first half followed after a beautiful appearance by pianist Simcock.
