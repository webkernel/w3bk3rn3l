## 1 What is Keybase

{{< admonition note "Keybase has been acquired by Zoom" >}}
Well....first of all let me start by telling you that [Zoom](https://zzom.us/) has acquired [Keybase](https://keybase.io).
{{< /admonition >}}

[:(far fa-folder-open fa-fw): Keybase (macOS, Linux, Windows, iPhone/iPad, Android)](https://keybase.io/download/) is an end-to-end encryption software that is used mainly for secure messaging and file sharing. It is a **place for work (or not)** that uses public key cryptography to ensure that messages stay private. It is suitable for families, roommates, clubs, and groups of friends.

You can share files securely by sharing folders with photos, videos, and documents with **end-to-end encryption**.

<!--- ![File Sharing Preview](/images/why-do-i-use-keybase/file_sharing.png "File Sharing preview") --->

One of the interesting features **Keybase** offers is **exploding messages**. You can set a timer on your sensitive messages and they are deleted.

<!--- ![Exploding Messages](/images/why-do-i-use-keybase/onetime.png "Exploding Messages preview") --->

Keybase connects to **public identities**, too. You can connect with communities from Twitter, Reddit, and elsewhere.

## 2 Your Account

Your Keybase account is secured by public-key cryptography. Installing Keybase on your computer or device, adding more devices and paper keys, adding proofs, and following all make your Keybase account more trustworthy and secure.


<br>

![Account Profile](/images/why-do-i-use-keybase/account-profile.png "Your username, devices, proofs, and followers are visible on your Keybase profile")

<br>


Keybase **documentation** says:

*Your Keybase account and everything you store or share through it in [Chat](https://book.keybase.io/chat), [Files](https://book.keybase.io/files), [Teams](https://book.keybase.io/teams), [Sites](https://book.keybase.io/sites), [Wallet](https://book.keybase.io/wallet), and [Git](https://book.keybase.io/git) are all protected with encryption.*

*When you create your Keybase account, it’s linked to your [devices](https://book.keybase.io/account/devices). You further protect your account with [proofs](https://book.keybase.io/account/proofs) and [following](https://book.keybase.io/account/following). All of these actions are backed by public-key cryptography.*

*You can learn more about how public-key cryptography works in [Security](https://book.keybase.io/security). The gist is that, thanks to public-key cryptography your contacts can be sure your Keybase account belongs to you and that only you can access it. No phishing, spoofing, or scamming around here.*

<br>

{{< admonition tip "Keybase Account is trustworthy" >}}
Your Keybase account is trustworthy and secure because—instead of being protected by just a password—it’s cryptographically linked to your devices. Your account can only be accessed through your devices. So long as only you have access to your devices, only you can access your Keybase account.
{{< /admonition >}}

### 2.1 Username

There are 3 things you need to know about **usernames**:

1. Your username is **public** and **can’t be changed**  
2. Usernames must be **lowercase letters and numbers only, with no spaces**  
3. Deleting a username and account is **permanent**  

Check it by reading [Keybase username docs](https://book.keybase.io/account#usernames)

### 2.2 Devices

When you create your Keybase account, Keybase creates a **key pair** for your account and the device **—your phone or computer—** that you sign up with.

You can think of your **devices** and **paper keys** as keys to your account. You can only access your account through your devices. Paper keys provide backup access to your account in case you lose your devices.

![Devices](/images/why-do-i-use-keybase/devices.png "Adding more devices and paper keys helps make your account more secure")

{{< admonition tip "Add multiple devices" >}}
Add multiple devices and paper keys to your account to ensure its security.
{{< /admonition >}}

Check it by reading [Keybase devices docs](https://book.keybase.io/account#devices)

### 2.3 Proofs

The best way to let others know that your Keybase account belongs to you is to **tell them in person**. The next best way is through **proofs**.

Proofs link your Keybase account to your other online accounts. Proofs help people trust **that you are really you** on Keybase.

![Proofs](/images/why-do-i-use-keybase/proofs.png "You can link your Twitter and GitHub accounts and personal website to your Keybase account as proofs")

{{< admonition tip "Add as many proofs as you can" >}}
Add as many proofs as you can to provide the most assurance that you are you on Keybase.
{{< /admonition >}}

Check it by reading [Keybase proofs docs](https://book.keybase.io/account#proofs)

### 2.4 Following

Following helps keep Keybase accounts secure. It allows you and those you interact with to be **notified** quickly if something on an account changes, indicating that it may be **compromised** and isn’t **trustworthy**.

Following helps confirm that people are **who they say** they are on Keybase. But it doesn’t necessarily indicate a relationship. More importantly, following helps provide **reassurance** that accounts are **trustworthy** and **secure**.

1. Follow people you interact with
2. More followers provide more security
3. Older followers provide more security than newer ones
4. Follow soon and follow often


{{< admonition tip "Blocking followers" >}}
While even followers you don’t know help keep your account trustworthy, you can block them.

When you block someone, you can remove them from your public list of followers. You won’t see them and their account will not be publicly associated with yours. They also won’t be able to chat with you or add you to a team.

But please note, they will still, technically, be following you. The public record that was created when they followed you will still exist. And they may know that you blocked them if they attempt to chat with you or add you to a team. You can learn more about blocking in [Chat](https://book.keybase.io/chat).
{{< /admonition >}}

## 3 Chat

With Keybase you can message your friends, share important info with colleagues, or organize entire projects. All of your chats on Keybase happen in one secure inbox, so **you don't have to worry about privacy**.

![Chat](/images/why-do-i-use-keybase/chat.png "One-on-one chats are organized at the top of your inbox")

## 4 Files

Your most important documents, photos, and videos can be safe and secure by using Keybase **Files**.

You can store and share files from any device. **Individuals** can store up to **250 GB** and **teams** can store up to **100 GB**.

Files are automatically end-to-end **encrypted** and signed by you. When a file is signed by you, your private key is used in the encryption. When it’s decrypted, your recipient knows for certain it came from you. Rest assured, they **won’t** be able to see or guess your private key.

The important thing is: **no phishing scams or malevolent links** around here.

More about **Files** here: [Keybase file docs](https://book.keybase.io/files#)

## 5 Teams

With Teams you can work, connect, and organize. A team on Keybase is simply a group of people. Teams can **chat**, use **files**, and **collaborate** on Git.

Team chats, files, and Git are end-to-end **encrypted**. What you and your team share, store, and commit stays between you and your team.

Cryptography also protects the integrity of teams on Keybase. Every team member gets a shared key pair. The private key only lives on their devices and is changed anytime someone on the team is removed or revokes a device. This key guarantees that only team admins can add or remove people and edit their permissions.

Person-to-person interactions remain private. Team admins and owners can’t access one-on-one chats between team members or any other interactions they’re not explicitly a part of.

<br>

![Teams](/images/why-do-i-use-keybase/teams.png "Create or access teams")

More about **Teams** here: [Keybase teams docs](https://book.keybase.io/teams)

## 6 Sites

{{< admonition note "Host a website" >}}
With Keybase Files you can easily build and host a **simple website** in your public folder.
{{< /admonition >}}

More about **Sites** here: [Keybase sites docs](https://book.keybase.io/sites#)

## 7 Wallet

You can use Keybase **Wallet** to send, receive, and exchange Stellar Lumens (XLM) and other currencies that are trusted through the Stellar network. All of your transactions are automatically tied to your Keybase account.

{{< admonition note "Some Wallet features " >}}
1. It works on any device you use Keybase on  
2. Amounts are automatically converted into the currency of your choice  
{{< /admonition >}}

You can learn more on the [blog](https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-stellar-launch). Or, join the team **stellar.public** to chat with others.

More about **Wallet** here: [Keybase wallet docs](https://book.keybase.io/wallet#)

## 8 Git

Keybase supports free, encrypted, authenticated, and private **Git repositories**.

You can put any kind of content in these repositories, but they’re especially useful for personal private repos or for secret content shared among teams.

These repositories are real **Git repositories** but you can view them in the Keybase app. They’re 100% **private**, **encrypted**, and **verified**.

<br>

![Git](/images/why-do-i-use-keybase/git.png "Create a git repository")

More about **Git** here: [Keybase wallet docs](https://book.keybase.io/git#)

## 9 Tools

You can **encrypt**, **decrypt**, **sign**, and **verify** messages and files that need to exist outside of Keybase but remain safe and secure.

Messages and files that have been encrypted or signed through Keybase are converted into a Keybase format called [Saltpack](https://saltpack.org/) (you’ll see Saltpack in the file names). (Encrypted or signed text is also known as **ciphertext**.)

This allows you to encrypt or sign messages or files and then share or store them safely anywhere. You can decrypt and verify messages and files from others.

<br>

![Tools](/images/why-do-i-use-keybase/tools.png "Encrypt, Decrypt, Sign and Verify")

More about **Tools** here: [Keybase tools docs](https://book.keybase.io/tools)

D - [Docs](https://book.keybase.io/docs)

## 11 Conclusion

**Keybase** is a privacy-oriented set of tools that is aimed to the **advanced user**. It isn't very popular due to the device registration and proofs process but this is what makes Keybase an outstanding end-to-end encrypted **Swiss-knife** solution for **chat**, **file sharing** and **collaborative** platform.

Highly recommended.
